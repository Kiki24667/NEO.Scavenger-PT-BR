A protestor associated with an international peace movement was arrested Thursday after bypassing the Active Denial System (ADS) perimeter at Camp Grayling in a "tinfoil suit".
Jack Haley, 43, of Grayling, MI was cited on suspicion of trespassing on government property. He was found by security forces after crossing a runway, wearing a reflective suit composed of aluminum foil. It is believed the foil allowed him to bypass the ADS unharmed.
When asked if this constituted a failure in the ADS, an Army spokesman said, "We had a breach, we responded, and everybody walked away healthy. I don't think we have any more concerns today than we had before."</column>

Local engineering firm Stansted Automated has been contracted to install an optical and radio registration system for automated vehicle guidance. The system will be one of the first of its kind, allowing both ground- and aerial-based unmanned vehicles to navigate the facility without human oversight.</column>

For the third day, picketers assembled outside Camp Grayling, where it was recently revealed that the new "energized perimeter" is the Department of Defense's Active Denial System (ADS).
The ADS operates by emitting microwave fields at a frequency which induces a burning sensation in the skin of the target. Critics of the system cite concerns that prolonged exposure has resulted in 2nd- and 3rd-degree burns during testing and if left unchecked could prove life-threatening.
A spokesman for the Pentagon's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate said, "The system has completed all formal legal and treaty compliance laws."</column>

The U.S. Coast Guard unleashed cannon fire Thursday at an abandoned vessel found drifting 50km off the coast of South Carolina. The vessel had no markings other than the code "D32" and was not found to have any crew or cargo.
The plans to sink the ship were briefly put on hold earlier Thursday when a fishing vessel, the 62-foot Eleganza, claimed salvage rights over the ghost ship. However, officials told Ox News that the Eleganza was unable to tow the abandoned ship, and scuttling operations resumed.</column>

Seventeen more lives, including those of three Coast Guard crewmembers, were claimed by smallpox Sunday night. The Guardsmen were crew aboard the Edward Rose, the Coast Guard vessel responsible for scuttling the derelict ship, labeled only with "D32", off the coast of South Carolina two weeks ago. In addition, two of the deaths were of crewmen of the salvage ship which failed to tow the "D32" to shore.
The recent connection between these deaths and the derelict ship has caused investigators to consider "D32" as a possible source of the outbreak. In a race against time, officials are assembling a diving research team to return to the scuttle site, hoping to find any information to explain the sudden outbreak.</column>

Last week's smallpox outbreaks in Chicago, Minneapolis, and Denver may have prompted a nationwide grounding of all air travel, but the pandemic smallpox continues to spread around the world. Researcher Gary Bardi, of the Health Protection Agency in the U.K., says this is no surprise.
Using data that modeled the effect of travel restrictions on the spread of a pandemic, Bardi showed that even in the best-case scenario, a pandemic would merely be postponed by several weeks. "This is assuming that 99.9 percent of all travelers are stopped after the first case. As you can see," he says, "it delays things a bit, but even such an extreme intervention is not effective."</column>

North America has joined the ranks of regions plagued by so-called wolf "super packs". Known for hunting in smaller packs of just six or seven, wolves have always been a common sight in less populated areas of the continent. However, recent surges in wolf attacks suggest a "super pack" may be prowling the Lakes region, numbering as many as 400.
Naturalists are hesitant to report a definite cause, though many point out that imbalances in the ecosystem can sometimes drive wolves into more populated areas to search for food. Horse and cattle owners are reporting alarming rates of animal losses as a result of the migration, and authorities are worried the attacks could soon escalate to human prey.</column>
